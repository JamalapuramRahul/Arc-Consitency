#Programming Assignment 2

The zip file has 4 .py files which are named after their numbers, such as pa2a.py for the 2a functionality
Also I have added the ipynb file which can be easily opened up in either google colab or the jupyter notebook and run:

For the .py files:
use -> pip install numpy 
use -> python3 filename.py 
console will prompt the user to enter the filename, please enter the filename with .txt extension.
The File should contain only 3 space seperated integer values in each line and no line has to be empty, as the extreme file handling cases are not handled. we will experience a "list index out of range error"

the output is displayed in the command line.

for ipynb
open ipynb file in either google colab,  jupyter notebook, each program will be populated in each change the input filename near the "with open textfile name".
